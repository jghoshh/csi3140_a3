## Rules: 
- Use the ```LEFT``` and ```RIGHT``` arrow keys to move PACMAN consume as many hollow circles as possible without encountering a ghost.
- If PACMAN encounters a ghost, the game ends and the final score is printed out.
- If PACMAN encounters a cherry, the ghosts on the board are turned into surprised faces.
- If PACMAN encounters a suprised face, PACMAN consumes it and gains 5 points. 
- If PACMAN encounters a hollow circle, PACMAN consumes it and gains 1 point.
